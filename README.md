# Raytracer
This is a raytracer written in C++ with the help of OpenGL. It has been developed as part of Computer Graphics group project with two other people.

As part of the project I:
- Implemented a tree acceleration structure (BVH) to boost ray tracing rendering times
- Implemented glossy reflections to mimic polished metal look for certain materials
- Implemented a post-processing bloom filter effect
